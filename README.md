# Amazon-best-seller-analysis
This project aims to explore the relationship between book attributes and their popularity, as measured by the number of reviews they receive on Amazon. From the publishers point of view, this analysis could be useful in determining which categories of books are most successful to minimize the loss from picking up non-performing books/authors.
