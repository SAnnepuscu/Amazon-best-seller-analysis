# Amazon-best-seller-analysis
This project aims to explore the relationship between book attributes and their popularity, as
measured by the number of reviews they receive on Amazon. Amazon started as a book store and
expanded into the ecommerce space. From the publishers point of view, this analysis could be useful in
determining which categories of books are most successful to minimize the loss from picking up
non-performing books/authors. Through exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques such
as natural language processing and k-means clustering, we identify several factors that are positively
correlated with book popularity, including lower prices, higher ratings, and certain genres such as fiction.
We also use natural language processing techniques to analyze the titles of the books, identifying the
words and phrases that are most strongly associated with positive reviews. The results of this project have
important implications for both authors and publishers, as they provide insights into the factors that drive
book popularity and can inform decisions on book pricing, marketing, and promotion strategies.
